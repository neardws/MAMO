    """The Adder interface.

    An adder packs together data to send to the replay buffer, and potentially
    performs some reduction/transformation to this data in the process.

    All adders will use this API. Below is an illustrative example of how they
    are intended to be used in a typical RL run-loop. We assume that the
    environment conforms to the dm_env environment API.

    ```python
    # Reset the environment and add the first observation.
    timestep = env.reset()
    adder.add_first(timestep.observation)

    while not timestep.last():
        # Generate an action from the policy and step the environment.
        action = my_policy(timestep)
        timestep = env.step(action)

        # Add the action and the resulting timestep.
        adder.add(action, next_timestep=timestep)
    ```

    Note that for all adders, the `add()` method expects an action taken and the
    *resulting* timestep observed after taking this action. Note that this
    timestep is named `next_timestep` precisely to emphasize this point.
